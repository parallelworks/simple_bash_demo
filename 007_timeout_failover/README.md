## Timeout Failover
The workflow performs the following tasks:

1. Creates a job script with the specified scheduler directives for the "Main Host" resource, supporting both PBS queues and SLURM partitions.
2. Submits the job with the specified command to the "Main Host" resource.
3. Waits for the job to finish within the specified maximum time on the "Main Host" resource.
4. Exits successfully if the job finishes before the specified time.
5. If the job does not finish within the specified time, kills the job on the "Main Host".
6. Creates a job script with the specified scheduler directives for the "Burst Host" resource, supporting both PBS queues and SLURM partitions.
7. Resubmits the job to the "Burst Host".
8. Waits for the job to finish within the specified maximum time on the "Burst Host" resource.
9. Exits successfully if the job finishes before the specified time.
10. If the job does not finish within the specified time on the "Burst Host", kills the job and fails.

This workflow accommodates running the job on both PBS queues and SLURM partitions, providing flexibility for different resource configurations.
